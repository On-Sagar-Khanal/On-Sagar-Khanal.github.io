</p>Hey you! I am a Civil Engineer and Researcher from [Pulchowk Campus, Nepal](https://pcampus.edu.np/). I will be starting my PhD in Fall 2025, focusing on disaster risk and resilience. My research interests lie in the field of disasters, and I enjoy learning and employing diverse methods to understand the interactions between disasters and society. </p>
